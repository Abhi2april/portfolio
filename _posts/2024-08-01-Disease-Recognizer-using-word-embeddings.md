description: Disease Recognizer takes what patients describe (their symptoms), converts that information into a format that computers can understand (numbers), and then uses machine learning techniques to find patterns and make predictions about the disease the patient might have .

<h1>Overview</h1>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a780226-bb0c-425a-9316-3872f465b5ad" alt="rick-and-morty-morty-smith" />

<p>Disease Recognizer uses sentence embeddings generated by the <code>sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2</code> model to encode patient symptoms into a high-dimensional space. Machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression and KMeans Clustering, are employed to classify and group symptoms, ultimately predicting the associated disease.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Symptom Embedding</strong>: Converts text-based symptoms into embeddings using a pre-trained transformer model.</li>
    <li><strong>Disease Prediction</strong>: Classifies symptoms into disease categories using Logistic Regression.</li>
    <li><strong>Clustering</strong>: Groups similar symptoms using KMeans Clustering.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Visualization</strong>: Visualizes the embedded symptom data using t-SNE plots.</li>
    <li><strong>Interactive Prediction</strong>: Allows for real-time disease prediction based on new symptom inputs.</li>
</ul>
