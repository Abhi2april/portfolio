- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kozodoi/DMC_2020) with the source code and documentation
- [blog post](https://kozodoi.me/python/time%20series/demand%20forecasting/competitions/2020/07/27/demand-forecasting.html) with the detailed project description and solution overview

### Background
Forecasting demand is an important managerial task that helps to optimize inventory planning. The optimized stocks reduce retailer's costs and increase customer satisfaction due to faster delivery time. This project uses historical purchase data to predict demand for different products.

### Highlights
- worked on demand forecasting project as a part of Data Mining Cup 2020 competition
- developed a pipeline with thorough feature engineering and data aggregation
- implemented custom profit-driven loss functions for LightGBM models

- [discussion topic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ranzcr-clip-catheter-line-classification/discussion/226664) with the short summary

### Background
Hospital patients can have catheters and tubes inserted during their admission. If tubes are placed incorrectly, serious complications can occur later. Deep learning helps to automate detection of malpositioned tubes, reducing the workload of clinicians and preventing treatment delays.

### Highlights
- developed deep learning models to detect catheter and tube position on X-ray images
- created a comprehensive PyTorch GPU/TPU computer vision pipeline
- finished in the top-5% of the Kaggle competition leaderboard with silver medal

- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kozodoi/fairness) with the source code and documentation
- [blog post](https://kozodoi.me/r/fairness/packages/2020/05/01/fairness-tutorial.html) with the package overview and comprehensive tutorial

### Background
How to measure fairness of a machine learning model? To date, a number of algorithmic fairness metrics have been proposed, including demographic parity, equalized odds and others. To simplify calculation, visualization and comparison of different fairness metrics, we developed and published `fairness` R package.

### Highlights
- developing and supporting an R package for fair machine learning
- the package offers calculation, visualization and comparison of algorithmic fairness metrics
- the package is published on CRAN repository with more than 10k downloads
