Why do we need intermediate features?\n","\n","Extracting intermediate activations (also called features) can be useful in many applications. In computer vision problems, outputs of intermediate CNN layers are frequently used to visualize the learning process and illustrate visual features distinguished by the model on different layers. Another popular use case is extracting intermediate outputs to create image or text embeddings, which can be used to detect duplicate items, included as input features in a classical ML model, visualize data clusters and much more. When working with Encoder-Decoder architectures, outputs of intermediate layers can also be used to compress the data into a smaller-sized vector containing the data represenatation.
