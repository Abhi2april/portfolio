    "Many ML projects, including Kaggle competitions, have a similar workflow. You start with a simple pipeline with a benchmark model. Next, you begin incorporating improvements: adding features, augmenting the data, tuning the model... On each iteration, you evaluate your solution and keep changes that improve the target metric.\n",

    "This workflow involves running a lot of experiments. As time goes by, it becomes difficult to keep track of the progress and positive changes. Instead of working on new ideas, you spend time thinking:\n",

    "- “what was that hyperparameter value that worked so well last week?” \n",
    "\n",
    "You end up running the same stuff multiple times. If you are not tracking your experiments yet, I highly recommend you to start!\n",
    "In my previous Kaggle projects, I used to rely on spreadsheets for tracking. It worked very well in the beginning, but soon I realized that setting up and managing spreadsheets with experiment meta-data requires loads of additional work. I got tired of manually filling in model parameters and performance values after each experiment and really wanted to switch to an automated solution. \n",

    "After doing it for a while, you will notice that maintaining a spreadsheet starts eating too much time. You need to manually fill in a row with meta-data for each new experiment and add a column for each new parameter. This will get out of control once your pipeline becomes more sophisticated. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also very easy to make a typo, which can lead to bad decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "When working on one deep learning competition, I incorrectly entered a learning rate in one of my experiments. Looking at the spreadsheet, I concluded that a high learning rate decreases the accuracy and went on working on other things. It was only a few days later when I realized that there was a typo and poor performance actually comes from a low learning rate. This cost me two days of work invested in the wrong direction based on a false conclusion.\n"

    "\n",
    "A few months ago, our team was working on a Cassava Leaf Disease competition and used Google spreadsheets for experiment tracking. One month into the challenge, our spreadsheet was already cluttered:\n",
    "- Some runs were missing performance because one of us forgot to log it in and did not have the results anymore. \n",
    "- PDFs with loss curves were scattered over Google Drive and Kaggle Notebooks. \n",
    "- Some parameters might have been entered incorrectly, but it was too time-consuming to restore and double-check older script versions. \n",

    "It was difficult to make good data-driven decisions based on our spreadsheet.\n",

    "Even though there were only four weeks left, we decided to switch to Neptune. I was surprised to see how little effort it actually took us to set it up. In brief, there are three main steps:\n",

    "- install the neptune package in your environment,\n",
    "- include several lines in the pipeline to enable logging of relevant meta-data.\n",

    "You can read more about the exact steps to start using Neptune here. Of course, going through the documentation and getting familiar with the platform may take you a few hours.

I can not count how many times I lost all experiment outputs due to a notebook crash when training was taking just a few minutes more than the allowed 9-hour limit! \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid that, I would highly recommend setting up Neptune such that model weights and loss metrics are stored after each epoch. That way, you will always have a checkpoint uploaded to Neptune servers to resume your training even if your Kaggle notebook times out. You will also have an opportunity to compare your intermediate results before the session crash with other experiments to judge their potential."

    "\n",
    "The most convenient way to add the leaderboard score of your experiment to the Neptune tracking table is to use the \"resume run\" functionality. It allows you to update any finished experiment with a new metric with a couple of lines of code.
